Figures above exclude VAT, are correct as at November 2020 and are subject to future revision.

The above figures are the standard rate charged by Cambridge Digital Radio Limited for carriage on the Cambridge DAB multiplex.
For example, these are the charges that would typically apply to services broadcast by established commercial broadcasters such as those holding
national commercial licences (analogue or digital) and / or local commercial licences (analogue or digital).

The rates above are for the transmission of “broadcast ready” programme streams with the broadcaster providing encoding / text / pictures in a form
which can be fed into the multiplexer without further alteration.  CDR Limited can provide these and other services and support at additional cost.

Discount Factors:
Cambridge Digital Radio Limited may, solely at its own discretion and in light of its operational own circumstances, choose to offer individual discounts
on the above figures for one or more of the following reasons:

    • Broadcaster holds an analogue Community Radio Licence
    • Broadcaster holds a digital (C-DSPS) Community Radio Licence
